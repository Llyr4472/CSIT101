Welcome to a quick overview of **Newton's Laws of Motion**, the foundation of classical mechanics. Dive into this post to understand the core principles and access detailed notes.

## Newton's Laws

### First Law: The Law of Inertia
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

### Second Law: Force and Acceleration
The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically:
```bash
F = ma
```

### Third Law: Action and Reaction
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
