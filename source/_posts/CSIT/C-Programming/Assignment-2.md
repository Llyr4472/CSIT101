## 11. Differentiate multiprogramming and multitasking with examples.  

   **Answer:**
   Here’s the extended comparison for multiprogramming and multitasking:

   | **Parameter**               | **Multiprogramming**                                                            | **Multitasking**                                                                 |
   |-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **User Interaction**        | Minimal; designed for batch processing, with little to no direct user input      | High; enables direct interaction with multiple applications or tasks             |
   | **Execution Model**         | Background processing; runs multiple programs sequentially when one waits        | Interactive execution; multiple tasks run concurrently, giving the illusion of simultaneous execution |
   | **CPU Switching**           | Based on I/O operations; CPU switches between programs when one is blocked      | Time-sliced; CPU allocates time to each task, switching between them regularly    |
   | **Memory Management**       | Static memory allocation; programs are loaded into memory and reside there until completion | Dynamic memory allocation; memory is allocated and freed based on task requirements |
   | **User Perception**         | Batch processing model; users don’t interact with tasks while they are executing | Simultaneous execution of tasks, offering users a more responsive experience    |
   | **Task Scheduling**         | Focuses on process scheduling for efficient CPU utilization, with context switching based on I/O wait times | Uses time-sharing to allocate CPU time to tasks, often with preemptive or cooperative multitasking |
   | **System Complexity**       | Lower complexity; relies on efficient process scheduling and memory management  | Higher complexity; involves task prioritization, time slices, and inter-process communication |
   | **Examples**                | Early mainframe computers, batch processing, server-side background processing | Modern OS (Windows, macOS, Linux), smartphone operating systems, desktop systems |
   | **Advantages**              | Improved CPU utilization, increased throughput, reduced idle time               | Enhanced user experience, improved responsiveness, supports complex workflows  |
