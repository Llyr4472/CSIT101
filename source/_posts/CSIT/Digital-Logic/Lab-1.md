# Lab Work 1: Study of Basic Logic Gates and Verification of Truth Tables

This is the first lab experiment for the Digital Logic course. Below is the handwritten lab report for the experiment, which includes the objectives, theory, circuit diagrams, and observations for the study of basic logic gates and verification of truth tables for AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR gates.
